# Basic-Python-Contact-Book
Simple contact book made in python


This project is intended to essentially mimic a contact book.

What you can do: 
   - store the name of the person 
   - store the person's phone number
   - search person name and number in your contact book
   - exit/quit/terminate program

The first function creates the menu we will be selecting from
In order to use the menu I created a variable where I 
Collect user input and is stored in the variable. I also return 
The value of the user input and create an instance 
Of the function to pass to the second function.
